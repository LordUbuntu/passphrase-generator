# Passphrase Generator

This was a humble passphrase generator that I wrote for my own personal use. It is very simple and unimpressive, it is not very exceptional among the 418 other passphrase generators on github besides it, but it is exactly what I need for my own personal use. I had a lot of fun making this passphrase generator, and I'm very proud of it despite how simple it is.

I created this repository to metaphorically 'hang' it on the 'trophy shelf' of github so that I could store it away and admire it as one of the neater small projects I've written. That wasn't the only reason, this repository also serves to make it easier to externally store and retrieve the script when I need it, and this repository also serves to let anyone who is interested have a gander as well if they're so inclined to.
