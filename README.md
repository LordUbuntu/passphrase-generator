# Passphrase Generator

This was a humble passphrase generator that I wrote for fun and demo purposes. It is very simple and unimpressive, it is not very exceptional among the 418 or so other passphrase generators on github besides it, but it is exactly what I need for my own personal use. I had a lot of fun making this passphrase generator, and I'm very proud of it despite how simple it is.

I created this repository to metaphorically 'hang' it on the 'trophy shelf' of github so that I could store it away and admire it as one of the neater small projects I've written. This also serves to let anyone who is interested have a gander as well if they're so inclined to.
